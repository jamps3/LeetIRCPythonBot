# Tamagotchi Toggle Fix

## Problem
The `!tamagotchi toggle` command was saying "Tamagotchi responses are now disabled" but the tamagotchi functionality continued to work. The toggle state was not persistent across bot restarts.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the `tamagotchi_enabled` state was only being changed in memory and not persisted to storage. When the bot was restarted, it would reload the default state from the environment variable.

## Solution
Implemented persistent state management using the existing `.env` file configuration:

### Changes Made

1. **Added .env file update function** in `bot_manager.py`:
   - `_update_env_file()`: Updates TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED setting in .env file
   - Handles commented lines and maintains file structure

2. **Enhanced toggle function** `toggle_tamagotchi()`:
   - Now calls `_update_env_file()` to persist changes to .env file
   - Updates both runtime state and environment variable
   - State changes are immediately persisted to .env file

3. **Simplified initialization**:
   - Uses existing environment variable approach (TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED)
   - No additional JSON file needed

### How It Works

1. **On startup**: Bot loads state from `TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED` environment variable (as before)
2. **On toggle**: State is immediately saved to .env file and environment variable is updated
3. **Message processing**: Only processes tamagotchi messages when `self.tamagotchi_enabled` is `True`

### .env File Format
```bash
# Tamagotchi Settings
TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED=true   # or false
```

### Commands
- `!tamagotchi toggle` - Toggles tamagotchi functionality on/off with persistence
- `!tamagotchi` - Shows current tamagotchi status

### Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_tamagotchi_toggle.py`) that verifies:
- ✅ State persistence across bot restarts
- ✅ Toggle functionality works correctly
- ✅ Message processing respects enabled/disabled state
- ✅ Fallback to environment variable when state file is missing
- ✅ State file creation and updates

## Benefits
- **Persistent**: Toggle state survives bot restarts
- **Reliable**: Tamagotchi functionality truly stops when disabled
- **Backward compatible**: Still respects `TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED` environment variable as fallback
- **User-friendly**: Each user's preference is remembered

## Files Modified
- `bot_manager.py` - Added persistence logic
- `.gitignore` - Added state file exclusion
- `test_tamagotchi_toggle.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `TAMAGOTCHI_TOGGLE_FIX.md` - This documentation
