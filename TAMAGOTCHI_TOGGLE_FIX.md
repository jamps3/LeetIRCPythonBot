# Tamagotchi Toggle Fix

## Problem
The `!tamagotchi toggle` command was saying "Tamagotchi responses are now disabled" but the tamagotchi functionality continued to work. The toggle state was not persistent across bot restarts.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the `tamagotchi_enabled` state was only being changed in memory and not persisted to storage. When the bot was restarted, it would reload the default state from the environment variable.

## Solution
Implemented persistent state management for the tamagotchi toggle functionality:

### Changes Made

1. **Added state persistence functions** in `bot_manager.py`:
   - `_load_tamagotchi_state()`: Loads state from JSON file, fallback to environment variable
   - `_save_tamagotchi_state()`: Saves current state to JSON file

2. **Updated initialization** in `BotManager.__init__()`:
   - Now uses `_load_tamagotchi_state()` instead of just reading environment variable
   - State file path: `tamagotchi_enabled.json`

3. **Enhanced toggle function** `toggle_tamagotchi()`:
   - Now calls `_save_tamagotchi_state()` after changing state
   - State changes are immediately persisted to disk

4. **Added state file to gitignore**:
   - `tamagotchi_enabled.json` is now ignored to prevent committing user preferences

### How It Works

1. **On startup**: Bot loads state from `tamagotchi_enabled.json` if it exists, otherwise falls back to `TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED` environment variable
2. **On toggle**: State is immediately saved to the JSON file
3. **Message processing**: Only processes tamagotchi messages when `self.tamagotchi_enabled` is `True`

### File Structure
```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Commands
- `!tamagotchi toggle` - Toggles tamagotchi functionality on/off with persistence
- `!tamagotchi` - Shows current tamagotchi status

### Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_tamagotchi_toggle.py`) that verifies:
- ✅ State persistence across bot restarts
- ✅ Toggle functionality works correctly
- ✅ Message processing respects enabled/disabled state
- ✅ Fallback to environment variable when state file is missing
- ✅ State file creation and updates

## Benefits
- **Persistent**: Toggle state survives bot restarts
- **Reliable**: Tamagotchi functionality truly stops when disabled
- **Backward compatible**: Still respects `TAMAGOTCHI_ENABLED` environment variable as fallback
- **User-friendly**: Each user's preference is remembered

## Files Modified
- `bot_manager.py` - Added persistence logic
- `.gitignore` - Added state file exclusion
- `test_tamagotchi_toggle.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `TAMAGOTCHI_TOGGLE_FIX.md` - This documentation
